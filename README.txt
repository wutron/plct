ABOUT

PLCT is a phylogenetic package for understanding gene tree evolution through
gene duplications, losses, and coalescence with multiple samples per species.
PLCT relies on the partially labeled coalescent tree data structure.
The package includes a program for determining reconciliation feasibility.

Coalescence with Multiple Individuals per Species.
In prep.

This package includes the Python source code of the program,
as well as several useful utilities for working with PLCTs.
